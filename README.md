# Software Design (2021-2022) | Lab 5

This is the repository containing the code for the 5th lab session of the Software Design course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
In this lab, we will demonstrate how to implement the Iterator, Singleton, Flyweight and Factory Method design patterns.

- The code in the ```main``` branch is where we left off in Lab 4.
- The code in the ```initial``` branch contains a modified version of the code from ```main```, ready for us to implement our design patterns.
- The code in the ```improved``` branch contains the final version with all 4 design patterns implemented.
